      "Transcribed Text: Aws is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. Millions of customers trust Aws to power their infrastructure and applications. Organizations of every type and size are using Aws to lower costs become more agile and innovate faster. Aws provides on demand delivery of technology services via the internet. With pay as you go pricing, you can use these services to build and run virtually any type of application without upfront costs or ongoing commitments. You only pay for what you use. Aws gives you more services and more features within those services than any other cloud provider. This makes it faster, easier and more cost effective to move your existing applications to the cloud and to build anything you can imagine from infrastructure technologies like compute storage and databases to emerging technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics. An internet of things building on Aws means you can choose the right tool for the job. For example, Aws offers the widest variety of databases that are purpose built for different types of applications with Aws. You can leverage the latest technologies to experiment and innovate more quickly. We are continually accelerating our pace of innovation to invent entirely new technologies you can use to transform your business like pioneering the serverless computing space with the launch of Aws LAMBDA, which lets developers run their code without provisioning or managing servers and Aws built Amazon Sage Maker, a fully managed machine learning service that empowers everyday developers and scientists to use machine learning. Without any previous experience, we are constantly expanding our global network of Aws regions. So you can access Aws services to build and run your applications from anywhere in the world. Each of these regions has multiple availability zones that are physically separated from each other and connected by low latency, high throughput and highly redundant networking. This makes it easy to design and operate applications that are scalable, fault tolerant and highly available. Our infrastructure is built to satisfy the security standards of the most risk sensitive organizations. You also have access to the Aws partner network which has thousands of systems integrators who specialize in Aws services and tens of thousands of independent software vendors who adapt their technology to work on Aws with the largest community of customers across every industry. Aws has unmatched experience and operational expertise you can depend upon for your most important applications in every imaginable use case.\n",

      "Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of it resources via the internet. With pay as you go pricing. Instead of buying, owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services such as computing, power storage and databases on an as needed basis. From a cloud provider like Amazon web services organizations of every type size and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics and customer facing web applications. For example, health care companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real time fraud detection and prevention and video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world. With cloud computing, your business can become more agile, reduce costs instantly scale and to play globally in minutes. Cloud computing gives you instant access to a broad range of technologies. So you can innovate faster and build nearly anything you can imagine from infrastructure services such as compute storage and databases to internet of things. Machine learning data analytics and much more, you can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the freedom to experiment and test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences and transform your business such as adding machine learning and intelligence to your applications. In order to personalize experiences for your customers and improve their engagement. You don't need to make large upfront investments in hardware and overpay for capacity you don't use instead, you can trade capital expense for variable expense and only pay for it as you consume it. With cloud computing, you access resources from the cloud in real time as they're needed, you can scale these resources up and down to grow or shrink capacity instantly as your business needs change, cloud computing also makes it easy to expand to new regions and to play globally in minutes. For example, Amazon web services has infrastructure all over the world. So you're able to deploy your application in multiple physical locations in just a few clicks, putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience no matter your location size or industry. The cloud frees you from managing infrastructure and data centers. So you can focus on what matters most to your business.\n",
